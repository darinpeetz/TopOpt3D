This repository contains the 3D parallel topology optimization code written in C++ by Darin Peetz

### What is this repository for? ###

This code uses Petsc to perform topology optimization at a large scale, similar to the code written by Aage and Lazarov (topopt.dtu.dk or https://github.com/topopt/TopOpt_in_PETSc).

### How do I get set up? ###

If Petsc, Slepc, and Parmetis are installed (Parmetis may have been installed as an external package to Petsc), a couple quick edits in the first ~10 lines of the makefile should have the program running.

### Who do I talk to? ###

Contact peetz2@illinois.edu with questions.
